# $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory: Monte Carlo Simulations

This repository contains a Python-based simulation framework for studying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories using Monte Carlo methods.  
It applies the Metropolis algorithm to explore phase transitions and gauge field dynamics in lower-dimensional systems.
